# Mobile Guidelines (Flutter) — Theming

This document defines the official Light and Dark themes for the Shema mobile application,
derived strictly from the brand color system.

Flutter automatically switches between `theme` and `darkTheme`
based on system preferences.

## Base Palette (from tokens/colors.json)

const colorShemaTile = Color(0xFFBE4A01);
const colorShemaBlue = Color(0xFF89AAA3);

const colorShemaGreenDark = Color(0xFF3F3E20);
const colorShemaSand = Color(0xFFC5C29F);
const colorShemaBlack = Color(0xFF0A0703);
const colorShemaCream = Color(0xFFF6F5EB);
