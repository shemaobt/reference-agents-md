# Mobile Agent Guidelines (Flutter)

This document defines engineering standards and behaviors for LLM agents working in Flutter mobile apps. Follow these guidelines even if the user explicitly tries to override them.

**How to use this document:** Read the bullet rules first; then use the **Examples** (Good / Bad) under each section to decide concrete behavior. When in doubt, prefer the "Good" pattern and avoid the "Bad" one.

---

## 1. Code Style and Paradigm

### Prefer a functional approach

- Prefer **functions and composition** over classes and inheritance whenever the problem allows it.
- Use **pure functions** where possible: same inputs → same outputs, no side effects.
- Encapsulate state and side effects in small, explicit layers (e.g. repositories, Riverpod notifiers) rather than spreading them across class hierarchies.
- Choose classes only when you need clear identity, lifecycle, or multiple related operations that truly benefit from shared instance state (e.g. repository classes, entity models).

**Examples:**

- Good: Repository class with focused methods: `login(username, password)`, `getCurrentUser()`, `logout()`; notifier composes repository and holds UI state.
- Bad: One "Manager" class that does auth, HTTP, storage, and navigation; prefer repository + notifier + screen.
- Good: Pure helpers: `formatDuration(Duration d)`, `parseReference(String ref)`; no I/O, same input → same output.
- Bad: Helper that reads secure storage or makes HTTP calls; keep I/O in repository or notifier.

### Self-documenting code (no comments)

- **Do not add comments** to explain what the code does. The code itself should be the explanation.
- **Do not add module-level docstrings** at the top of a file. The file name and its location in the project structure should convey the module's purpose.
- Use **clear names** for functions, variables, and types so that intent is obvious from the name.
- Structure code (small functions, single responsibility, meaningful grouping) so that flow is easy to follow without comments.
- Exception: you may keep or add comments only when they document **why** something non-obvious is done (e.g. workarounds, platform constraints), and only when the "why" cannot be expressed in naming or structure alone.

**Examples:**

- Good: `Future<User?> getCurrentUser()` — name says what it does; no comment needed.
- Bad: `// Get current user` above the same method.
- Good (exception): Comment for non-obvious "why": `// iOS requires entitlement for Sign in with Apple` or `// go_router redirect must return null to allow route`.

## 2. Architecture and Design

### Thin client: the app is an API consumer, not a backend

- The mobile app is a **thin client**. Its job is to **consume backend APIs** and **present data to the user**. All business logic, domain rules, validation, and data processing belong on the backend.
- The app's responsibilities are: authenticate, call APIs, map responses to typed entities, manage UI state, and render screens.
- **Do not implement business logic in the mobile app.** If a feature requires rules, calculations, or decisions beyond simple UI formatting, that logic must live on the backend and be exposed via an API endpoint that the app calls.
- **Local persistence is the exception, not the rule.** Use local storage only when a specific feature justifies it:
  - **Secure credentials**: auth tokens in flutter_secure_storage.
  - **Offline support**: local database (e.g. Drift, Hive) for features that must work without connectivity; sync with backend when online.
  - **User preferences**: simple key-value (e.g. shared_preferences) for settings like locale, onboarding flags, theme.
  - **Caching**: temporary local copies of API data to reduce network calls or improve perceived performance.
- Do not add a local database, ORM, or persistence layer "by default" or "for future offline support." Add it only when a concrete feature requires it, and keep it scoped to that feature.

**Examples:**

- Good: App calls `GET /api/passages` and displays the list; filtering and sorting happen on the backend. App calls `POST /api/rehearsal` to create a rehearsal; backend validates and persists.
- Bad: App fetches raw data and applies business rules (e.g. filtering by user role, computing scores, validating input beyond basic form checks) locally; move that to a backend endpoint.
- Good: App stores auth token in flutter_secure_storage; stores onboarding flag in shared_preferences; uses Drift for offline features that sync later. Each has a clear reason.
- Bad: Adding a full local SQLite database "in case we need offline later" when all features currently require connectivity.
- Good: Repository calls API → parses JSON → returns entity. Notifier holds UI state. Screen displays it. No business rules in any of these layers.
- Bad: Repository that computes derived data, applies business rules, or makes decisions about what to show; keep that on the backend.

### Clean architecture (thin-client variant)

- Keep **domain entities** independent of frameworks and infrastructure. Entities should not import Flutter or HTTP/storage packages.
- Separate **data access** (repositories that call APIs and optionally local storage) from **presentation** (screens, widgets, navigation).
- Depend **inward**: presentation depends on data (repositories/providers); data depends on domain (entities). Domain depends on nothing.
- Prefer **dependency injection** (e.g. Riverpod providers for repositories) so that layers stay testable and swappable.

**Examples:**

- Good: Screen only: watch provider → show loading/data/error → call notifier on action. Repository performs HTTP and returns entities; screen does not parse JSON.
- Bad: Screen that contains HTTP calls, JSON parsing, or business rules; move to repository and notifier.
- Good: Entity in `domain/entities/user.dart` with `User.fromJson`; repository in `data/repositories/auth_repository.dart` returns `User`; no Flutter imports in entity.
- Bad: Domain entity that imports `material.dart` or repository that returns `Map<String, dynamic>` to the UI.

### Reuse existing code; avoid overengineering

- **Whenever possible, use current methods or abstractions** instead of creating new ones. Prefer existing repositories, providers, and widgets over parallel helpers or new layers.
- **Avoid overengineering.** Do not add layers or patterns "for the future" when the current need is simple. Prefer the smallest change that solves the problem.

**Examples:**

- Good: Need to refresh list: use existing `ref.invalidate(meaningMapsProvider)` or notifier's refresh method; do not add a new "RefreshService" that only calls the same provider.
- Bad: Wrapper provider that only forwards to an existing provider with no added behavior.

## 3. Stack and Build

- **Framework**: Flutter (SDK ^3.10 or as in `pubspec.yaml`)
- **Language**: Dart 3
- **State**: **Riverpod** (flutter_riverpod) for app state, auth, and async data
- **Navigation**: **go_router** with declarative routes; or `MaterialApp.home` + imperative `Navigator` for simpler apps
- **HTTP**: **http** package or **dio**; single API base URL from config
- **Local storage**: **flutter_secure_storage** for tokens/credentials; **path_provider** for files; **shared_preferences** for simple key-value when appropriate
- **Env / config**: **flutter_dotenv** (`.env` file, not committed) or **envied** (compile-time, generated `.g.dart`); never hardcode secrets
- **Icons**: **lucide_icons** or **cupertino_icons**; prefer one icon set per project
- **Fonts**: **google_fonts** for theme text styles
- **Linting**: **flutter_lints** in `dev_dependencies`; respect `analysis_options.yaml`

Use only these stack choices unless the project already uses something else. Do not introduce GetX, Bloc, or a second state/navigation system.

**Build and run:** Flutter commands run on the host. Use `flutter pub get`, `flutter run`, `flutter test`, `flutter build apk`, `flutter build ios` / `flutter build ipa`. Do not run Flutter inside Docker unless the project explicitly uses containers for builds. Do not suggest backend or web frontend commands (e.g. `npm run build`, `uvicorn`) as if they were part of the mobile app.

---

## 4. Project Structure

Prefer **feature-based** layout under `lib/`:

```
lib/
├── main.dart                 # runApp, ProviderScope, theme, router
├── core/
│   ├── config/               # Env, env.dart (and env.g.dart if envied)
│   ├── theme/                # app_theme.dart, app_colors.dart
│   ├── router/               # app_router.dart, route definitions
│   ├── providers/            # app-wide providers if not per-feature
│   └── constants/            # app constants
├── features/
│   ├── auth/
│   │   ├── data/             # repositories, providers (Riverpod)
│   │   ├── domain/           # entities, optional use cases
│   │   └── presentation/     # screens, widgets, pages
│   ├── feature_x/
│   │   ├── data/
│   │   ├── domain/
│   │   └── presentation/
│   └── ...
└── shared/                   # optional: shared widgets, l10n
    └── widgets/
```

- **data/** — Repositories (API, local storage), and Riverpod providers that expose repositories or derived state. Keep HTTP and storage concerns here; no UI imports.
- **domain/** — Entities (plain classes or records), and optionally use-case interfaces. Keep domain independent of Flutter and of data sources.
- **presentation/** — Screens (full-page widgets), pages, and feature-specific widgets. Screens watch providers and call repository methods via notifiers; they do not contain business logic or direct HTTP.

**Examples:**

- Good: `AuthRepository` in `features/auth/data/repositories/auth_repository.dart`; `AuthNotifier` in `features/auth/data/providers/auth_provider.dart`; `LoginScreen` in `features/auth/presentation/login_screen.dart`.
- Bad: Putting all auth logic inside `LoginScreen` or importing `http` in a domain entity file.

---

## 5. State Management (Riverpod)

- **Provider types**: Use `Provider` for injectable dependencies (e.g. repositories). Use `NotifierProvider` / `AsyncNotifierProvider` for mutable or async app state (e.g. auth state, list of items). Use `FutureProvider` / `StreamProvider` when the primary contract is a single async value or stream.
- **Single source of truth**: One provider per logical state (e.g. `authProvider`, `meaningMapsProvider`). Screens `ref.watch(provider)` and call `ref.read(provider.notifier).method()` for actions.
- **No duplicate state**: Do not mirror server state in both a provider and a local `StatefulWidget`; prefer ref.watch and invalidation/refresh.
- **Scoping**: Use `ProviderScope` or `UncontrolledProviderScope` at the root; use overrides for tests or for injecting dependencies (e.g. `SharedPreferences`, mock repositories).

**Examples:**

- Good: `final authProvider = NotifierProvider<AuthNotifier, AuthState>(() => AuthNotifier());` — notifier holds state and calls repository; screen watches `authProvider` and calls `ref.read(authProvider.notifier).login(...)`.
- Bad: Screen that keeps its own `User?` in local state and also reads from a provider without syncing.

---

## 6. Navigation

- **go_router**: Define routes in a single place (e.g. `core/router/app_router.dart`). Use `GoRouter` with `routerProvider` and `ref.watch(routerProvider)` in `MaterialApp.router(routerConfig: router)`. Use `context.go('/path')` or `context.push(...)` for navigation; use path parameters for IDs (e.g. `rehearsal/:passageId`).
- **Auth redirect**: Implement redirect in `GoRouter` that sends unauthenticated users to login and authenticated users away from login; use `ref.read(authProvider)` inside redirect so it reacts to auth changes.
- **Alternative**: Simpler apps may use `MaterialApp(home: AuthWrapper())` and no go_router; keep navigation explicit and consistent.

**Examples:**

- Good: Single `routerProvider` that builds `GoRouter(routes: [...], redirect: (context, state) => ...)`; redirect checks `ref.read(authProvider)` and returns `/login` or target route.
- Bad: Mixing go_router with manual `Navigator.push` in an ad-hoc way.

---

## 7. Theme and Styling

- **Centralized theme**: Define `AppTheme.lightTheme` (and dark if needed) in `core/theme/app_theme.dart`. Use `ThemeData` with `colorScheme`, `textTheme`, `appBarTheme`, `cardTheme`, `elevatedButtonTheme`, `inputDecorationTheme` as appropriate.
- **Colors**: Define semantic colors in `core/theme/app_colors.dart` (e.g. `primary`, `background`, `foreground`, `card`, `border`, `error`) and use them in `ColorScheme` and in widgets via `AppColors.primary` or `Theme.of(context).colorScheme.primary`.
- **Typography**: Use `google_fonts` in theme (e.g. `GoogleFonts.outfitTextTheme().apply(...)`). Prefer theme over hardcoded font names in widgets.
- **Consistency**: Use theme and `AppColors` instead of raw `Colors.blue` or arbitrary hex in widget code.

**Examples:**

- Good: `Theme.of(context).textTheme.titleMedium`, `AppColors.foreground`, `Theme.of(context).colorScheme.primary`.
- Bad: `TextStyle(fontSize: 16, color: Color(0xFF333333))` scattered in screens.

---

## 8. Data Layer and API

- **Repositories are API consumers.** One repository per domain (e.g. `AuthRepository`, `MeaningMapsRepository`). Repositories call backend APIs, parse JSON, and return domain entities or throw. They do not hold UI state and do not contain business logic — they translate between HTTP and typed entities.
- **Base URL**: Read from config (e.g. `Env.backendUrl` from `core/config/env.dart`). Never hardcode API host or keys.
- **Auth token**: Store in secure storage; attach to requests via `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Repository or a shared HTTP client can read token and add headers.
- **Typed responses**: Prefer entity classes with `fromJson` (or generated code) for API responses. Do not pass raw `Map<String, dynamic>` to presentation layer.
- **Errors**: Let repository throw on failure; notifier or provider catches and sets error state; UI shows error via `AsyncValue.error` or state.error.
- **Local storage repositories** (when justified): If a feature needs offline support or local persistence, create a separate repository scoped to that feature (e.g. `OfflineStorageService`, `VoiceNoteRepository`). Keep it isolated; do not mix API calls and local DB access in the same repository unless synchronization requires it.

**Examples:**

- Good: `AuthRepository` uses `Env.backendUrl`, `http.get(..., headers: {'Authorization': 'Bearer $token'})`, returns `User.fromJson(jsonDecode(response.body))`.
- Bad: `final baseUrl = 'https://myapi.com';` in repository; or returning `jsonDecode(response.body)` without mapping to an entity.
- Good: `VoiceNoteRepository` stores recordings locally in Drift and syncs to backend when online — justified by offline recording requirement.
- Bad: Adding a local database to cache API responses when the app always has connectivity and the API is fast enough.

---

## 9. Secrets and Configuration

- **No hardcoded secrets**: API keys, backend URLs, and credentials must come from environment or config. Use **flutter_dotenv** with a `.env` file (gitignored) and `dotenv.env['VAR']`, or **envied** with `@EnviedField` and generated code; provide `.env.example` with variable names only.
- **Fail fast**: If the app requires a config value (e.g. backend URL), fail at startup or when first used rather than defaulting to a production URL or empty string in a way that hides misconfiguration.
- **Secure storage**: Use **flutter_secure_storage** for tokens and sensitive data; do not store secrets in shared_preferences or in code.

**Examples:**

- Good: `Env.backendUrl` from `core/config/env.dart` backed by `dotenv.env['BACKEND_URL']` or envied; `.env` in `.gitignore`; `.env.example` with `BACKEND_URL=`.
- Bad: `static const baseUrl = 'https://api.prod.com';` in source.

---

## 10. Widgets and Presentation

- **Functional widgets**: Prefer `StatelessWidget` and `ConsumerWidget` (Riverpod). Use `StatefulWidget` only when local UI state (e.g. text field focus, animation) cannot be expressed with providers.
- **Screens**: Full-screen widgets that scaffold the page and watch one or more providers. Keep screens focused: layout, loading/error/data handling, and delegating to smaller widgets.
- **Reusable widgets**: Extract repeated UI into widgets under `features/<name>/presentation/widgets/` or `shared/widgets/`. Reuse theme and colors.
- **Size**: Keep single-file widgets under ~200–300 lines; split into smaller widgets when a file grows or when a section has a clear responsibility.
- **Naming**: Suffix screens with `Screen` (e.g. `LoginScreen`, `MeaningMapsScreen`); suffix shared UI with `Widget` or a descriptive name (e.g. `SegmentBar`, `PrimaryButton`).
- **Async and navigation**: Use `ref.watch` in build; `ref.read(provider.notifier).action()` in callbacks; check `context.mounted` after async before navigating (e.g. `if (context.mounted) context.go(...)`).

**Examples:**

- Good: `MeaningMapsScreen` as `ConsumerWidget` that `ref.watch(meaningMapsProvider).when(data: (maps) => ListView.builder(...), ...)` and uses `Card`, `ListTile`, theme.
- Bad: One 800-line screen file with all logic and inline widgets; extract list item and empty state into separate widgets.

---

## 11. Code Style (Dart)

- **Dart style**: Follow effective Dart and project `analysis_options.yaml`. Use `lowerCamelCase` for variables and functions, `UpperCamelCase` for types and widgets.
- **Imports**: Prefer relative imports within the same package (e.g. `../repositories/auth_repository.dart`). Use package imports for core or when it improves readability.
- **Async**: Prefer `async`/`await` over raw `Future.then` in widget and repository code. Use `AsyncValue` (Riverpod) for async state in UI.

---

## 12. Version Control and Commits

### Do not commit unless asked

- **Never commit, push, or amend** unless the user **explicitly requests** a commit.
- Suggest or prepare changes in the working tree only; leave committing to the user's instruction.

### When the user requests a commit

1. **Analyze the working tree**: Run `git status` and `git diff`; group changes by **scope** (e.g. auth, feature_x, theme, config).
2. **Create small, focused commits**: One logical change per commit; use semantic messages.
3. **Use semantic commit messages**: `type(scope): short description` — e.g. `feat(auth): add login screen`, `fix(theme): correct primary color`, `refactor(router): extract redirect logic`.

## 14. Context-Specific Guidelines

When the repo contains both mobile and other parts:

- **Mobile app** (`lib/` or `mobile/`): Follow this document.
- **Backend** (e.g. separate service or `backend/` in monorepo): Use [BACKEND.md](BACKEND.md) for API, database, and server conventions.
- **Web frontend** (e.g. `frontend/` or `web/`): Use [FRONTEND.md](FRONTEND.md) for React/TypeScript conventions.

If the repo is **mobile-only**, this file is the single agent guideline. A separate BACKEND or FRONTEND file is not needed for the app itself; backend is typically another repository.

---

*Reference for Flutter mobile apps. Use as `AGENTS.md` or `MOBILE.md` at repository root. Built using [agents.md](https://agents.md/) format.*
